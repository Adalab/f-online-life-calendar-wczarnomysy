# Mood Calendar

_It is a Single Page Application created with React. Mood Calendar is used for setting a daily mood status. We start by filling a form, which includes selecting a date and if it was a good or bad day. In case of the good day we can also add a positive comment and after selecting 'Save' a happy face icon appears in the calendar. In case of the bad day after selecting 'Save' a sad face icon appears in the calendar. All the information: date, mood status and comment, is stored in the local storage, so we do not lose it in case of any electrical problems._
